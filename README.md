## About this project

The goal of this project is to demo how to use Laravel PHP to connect with
and chat with a Open AI assistant. 

The important part that I want to get going is that the assistant responds from
very specific materials and that when I get a response back, I am able to build
valid links to the source material. 

The intention is to create a highly trusted virtual assistant.
